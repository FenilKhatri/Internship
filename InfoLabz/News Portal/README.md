# 🌐 News Portal React App

This is my **first React.js project** — a dynamic News Portal that fetches and displays real-time business news based on the selected country. The project uses the [NewsData.io API](https://newsdata.io/) for fetching news headlines and integrates **Bootstrap 5** for a responsive UI.
